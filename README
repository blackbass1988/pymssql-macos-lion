Building
========

	Windows
	=======

	To build pymssql on Windows you firstly must have:

		* MinGW
            * If you wish to use Visual C++ >= 2005 (or some equivalent compiler) then you will have
              to compile FreeTDS yourself.
		* Python >= 2.5 (From the Python website)
		* Cython >= 0.13

	and then you can simple run:

		python setup.py build

	which will build pymssql in the normal python fashion.

	Unix
	====

	To build on Unix you must have:

		* gcc
		* python-dev >= 2.5
		* Cython >= 0.13
		* FreeTDS >= 0.82

Testing
=======

*** ALL DATA IN TESTING DBS WILL BE DELETED !!!! ***

You will need to install two additional packages for testing:

    easy_install nose SQLAlchemy

You should build the package with:

    python setup.py develop

You need to setup a tests.cfg file in tests/ with the correct DB connection
information for your environement:

    cd tests/
    cp tests.cfg.tpl tests.cfg
    vim|emacs|notepad tests.cfg

To run the tests:

    cd tests/
    nosetests

Which will go through and run all the tests with the settings from the DEFAULT
section of tests.cfg.

To run with a different tests.cfg section:

    nosetests --pymssql-section=<secname>

example:

    nosetests --pymssql-section=AllTestsWillRun

to avoid slow tests:

    nosetests -a '!slow'

to select specific tests to run:

    nosetests test_types.py
    nosetests test_types.py test_sprocs.py
    nosetests test_types.py:TestTypes
    nosetests test_types.py:TestTypes.test_image
